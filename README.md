# Solidity Learning Resources
Solidity is a high-level, statically-typed programming language designed specifically for writing smart contracts that run on Ethereum and other blockchain platforms. It is widely used for creating decentralized applications (dApps), handling digital assets, and implementing blockchain-based logic.

This repository contains several files aimed at helping beginners and enthusiasts learn Solidity. The examples and resources included here cover key concepts and practical implementations, making it a great starting point for those who want to dive into blockchain development and smart contract programming.

You can easily run and test the provided Solidity code using [Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/), an online tool that simplifies smart contract development and deployment.
Feel free to explore the files and use them as a reference for your learning journey!
